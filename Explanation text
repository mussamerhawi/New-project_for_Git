Here I am again to try things from the scratch and I think I am making a good progress. This time I started from creating a new directory in git terminal by the command "mk dir 
folder name" after going to the target directory where I wanted my new folder to be in. Then I used the "cd folder name" to set my new directory as working directory. Then I 
"git init" to create a new repository. I then had to make at least one commit before I try
linking it with my Github account. I created one file named README.md, git add'ed it and commit it with the message "initial commit".
Next is to create a new repository in Github and use the option "push existing repository in command line" and follow the instruction in that box to complete this part. Finally 
linked and here I am opening my new repository
from the other side of the door. I will now try to pull this text to my computer through the command line and see my self in the other room.
It worked!! This is now in my local folder.

Now I have created a new branch named "Tinu" (hadisye lol) and switched my working space to it. The changes I am making here are now saved only in this new branch. I will stage 
and commit these changes along with the new branch to my GitHub account and see them from that side if it goes well. The only command I should not forget is "git pish -u origin
<branch name>".
